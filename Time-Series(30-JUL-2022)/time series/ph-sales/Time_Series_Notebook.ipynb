    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data.Time series analysis is extensively used to forecast company sales, product demand, stock market trends, agricultural production etc.The fundamental idea for time series analysis is to decompose the original time series (sales, stock market trends, etc.) into several independent components.\n",
